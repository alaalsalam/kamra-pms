# MCP tool reference

HotelPMS exposes **52 governed tools** on the hosted MCP
endpoint (`/mcp`) and the stdio sidecar (`mcp/hotelpms_mcp.py`). Every
call runs as the connected user — role permissions apply, prices come
from the pricing engine, and each action is recorded in the activity
ledger.

This page is generated from `hotelpms/mcp_tools.py`. Re-run
`python3 gen_mcp_tools.py` in `docs-site/` when the registry changes.

## Front desk

Endpoint: `hotelpms.api.create_booking`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `waitlist_ready()`

Waitlisted stays that can NOW be booked — a room has freed up for their

estimated fee). ALWAYS read this to the guest before cancelling.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.api.cancellation_preview`.

### `cancel_booking(reservation, reason, note, waive_fee)`

Cancel a confirmed booking. The property's cancellation policy
applies automatically — free outside the window, else the configured

it to the guest. Reasons: Guest request, Change of plans, Duplicate
booking, Payment failed, Weather / travel disruption, Booked
elsewhere, Other. Only waive the fee when a manager authorizes it;
the waiver is logged.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.api.check_in`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.api.add_folio_charge`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `post_stay_charge(reservation, charge_type, description, amount, gst_rate, is_alcohol)`

Post a charge to a stay and let the company billing rules pick the
folio — corporate room/meals go to the Company folio, alcohol and
unruled charges to the guest. Prefer this over add_folio_charge when
you don't know which folio should carry the line.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.api.post_stay_charge`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `split_folio_charge(from_folio, charge_row, to_folio, percent, amount)`

## Revenue

### `set_room_rate(room_type, start_date, end_date, rate, reason)`

Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

## Briefings

### `owner_briefing(date)`

agent hours saved. Turn this into a short, warm briefing — never
change the figures.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.api.owner_briefing`.

### `position_briefing(date)`

The hotel-position briefing for the GM and front desk: today's
occupancy against the overbooking ceiling, arrivals sorted by ETA,
departures with ETDs and balances due, back-to-back room conflicts
(incoming guest lands before the outgoing one leaves), the demand
tier pricing is applying, and a 7-day occupancy outlook. Read it out
as a crisp shift briefing — never change the figures.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.api.position_briefing`.

## Night audit

### `run_night_audit(business_date)`

Run the end-of-day: post the night's room charges for in-house

block (list of {room_type, rooms_blocked, block_rate}) and optionally its
banquet event. The agent wedge: turn "30 rooms + a 200-pax wedding on
Dec 12" into a live proposal. Starts Open; confirming it holds the rooms
out of general sale until the cutoff date.

the group's dates against the held inventory.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.api.pickup_group_room`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

## Onboarding

### `setup_property(payload)`

Onboard a whole property in one call — the migration assistant's
tool. Ask the hotel for their room list/rate card (any format), map
it into: {property:{property_name, city, gstin?, phone?},
room_types:[{code,name,base_price,adults?}], rooms:[{room_type_code,
numbers:[..]}], meal_plans:[{code,price_per_adult}]}. Confirm the
mapping with the user before calling.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.api.setup_property`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `import_bookings(bookings, property)`

Migrate existing reservations from another PMS/spreadsheet. Each:
{guest_name, phone?, room_type_code, check_in, check_out, adults?,
amount_after_tax?, channel?, status?}. Fixed amounts are preserved;
otherwise the pricing engine quotes. Returns per-row errors — report
them to the user rather than silently dropping rows.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.api.import_bookings`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

## Banquets

### `banquet_availability(event_date, end_date, start_time, end_time, pax)`

Which halls are free for a date, hours and pax. A confirmed function
takes the hall; a tentative hold is shown as a soft hold you can still
sell over. Two functions can share a hall morning and evening — only a
real overlap in hours counts as taken. Run this before every enquiry.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.venue_availability`.

### `banquet_catalogue()`

What the property sells at a function: menu packages priced per plate
(with their courses), and the service list — LED wall, projector, DJ,
podium, stage, decor, laptop, bar. Read this before quoting anything;
never invent a price.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.banquet_catalogue`.

### `banquet_enquiry(venue, event_date, customer_name, event_type, attendees, customer_phone, customer_email, company, end_date, start_time, end_time, source, requirements)`

Open a function sheet from an enquiry. The hall's rack rental goes on
as the first line and a follow-up is diarised, so the enquiry can't go
quiet. Check banquet_availability first.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.create_enquiry`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `banquet_sheet(function)`

One function in full: dates, pax (expected / guaranteed / actual),
every line item with its chargeable flag, the negotiation history,
payment terms, receipts, and what it still needs from somebody.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.function_sheet`.

### `banquet_add_menu(function, menu, qty, rate, chargeable)`

Put a menu package on a function. Left alone the quantity follows the
pax rule (guaranteed, or actual if more turned up) and the price is the
package's own plate price. chargeable=0 gives it away — it still prints
on the event order, it just leaves the quote.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.add_menu`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `banquet_add_service(function, service_item, qty, rate, chargeable)`

Put a service on a function — projector, LED wall, DJ, podium, stage,
decor, laptop, bar. The catalogue decides chargeable by default; pass
chargeable=0 to throw it in for this function.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.add_service`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `banquet_negotiate(function, discount_amount, venue_rental, note)`

Move the price: a headline discount on the whole quote, or the hall
rate on its own. Every move is snapshotted with what the quote was worth
before and after, so the fourth revision stays explainable. Confirm the
new total with the user before calling.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.negotiate`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `banquet_payment_terms(function, terms, note)`

Set the payment schedule: [{milestone, due_date, percent | amount}].
A term stated as a percentage follows the quote as it moves; one stated
as an amount is a number both sides agreed and stays put.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.set_payment_terms`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `banquet_record_receipt(function, amount, mode, kind, reference)`

Record money in against a function (Advance / Payment / Security
Deposit / Refund).

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.record_receipt`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `banquet_status(function, status, reason)`

Move a function along: Enquiry → Tentative → Confirmed → Completed, or
out as Cancelled / Lost. Cancelling or losing needs a reason. Confirming
takes the hall and will refuse a clash with another confirmed function.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.set_status`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `banquet_quote(function, valid_days)`

Stamp a quotation — bumps the version, dates it, and returns the whole
document so it can be read back or emailed.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.generate_quote`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `banquet_event_order(function)`

Issue the banquet event order — the running sheet the banquet, kitchen
and AV teams work the day from, with the menus expanded into courses.
Only a confirmed function gets one.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.generate_beo`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `banquet_document(function, kind)`

Fetch a function's paper without re-issuing it. kind: quote, contract,
beo, pack_list, invoice. The pack list is what physically has to reach
the hall, complimentary items included.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.banquet_document`.

### `banquet_pipeline(from_date, to_date, months)`

The banquet sales picture, month by month and by status: what's
confirmed, what's still in play, what's outstanding, the conversion
rate, and why business went away. Dated on the event, not the enquiry.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.banquet_pipeline`.

### `banquet_reminders(days)`

Everything that needs chasing: follow-ups gone quiet, tentative holds
about to lapse, payments due, event orders missing before the date,
functions confirmed with nothing received.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.banquet_reminders`.

### `banquet_month(month)`

Every hall and every session across a whole month — the grid that
answers "do you have the 14th of December?" in one look. Halls are sold
by session (Morning / Afternoon / Evening), not by the hour, so a hall
can take a morning conference and an evening wedding on the same day.
month is YYYY-MM; omit for the current one.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.month_availability`.

### `banquet_close_out(function, damage_amount, damage_note, pax_actual, refund_deposit)`

Hand the hall back after the function. Records the covers actually
served, deducts any damage from the refundable deposit — a reason is
required, and you can't deduct more than is held — and returns the rest
as a real refund line. Closes the function.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.close_out`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `banquet_register(register, from_date, to_date)`

The banquet office's books for a period. register is one of:
functions (everything booked), quotations (what was quoted and whether
it landed), enquiries (what came in), receipts (the cash book, by
mode), sales (revenue rolled up by hall, event type, session and
source).

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.banquet_register`.

### `banquet_menu_card(function)`

What will actually be served, course by course, with no prices on it
— the sheet the customer signs off and the kitchen cooks from.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.menu_card`.

### `banquet_receipt_document(function, receipt)`

One receipt as a document the customer can keep, with the amount in
words and the running balance on the function.

Endpoint: `hotelpms.banquet.receipt_document`.
