# Self-hosting on DigitalOcean

## 1. Create the server

Create a **Droplet** → Ubuntu 24.04 → **Basic / Regular** → the **4 GB / 2 vCPU** plan (~$24/mo) → choose the region nearest your hotel → add your SSH key. The droplet's IP appears on creation.

## 2. Point your domain

Add an **A record** for `pms.yourhotel.com` → the server's IP at your
DNS provider. (If you use Cloudflare, set it to *DNS only* while issuing
the SSL certificate.)

## 3. Install Docker

```bash
ssh root@<server-ip>
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

## 4. Install HotelPMS

From here it's identical everywhere — follow the
[Quickstart](/quickstart): build the image with HotelPMS in `apps.json`,
bring the compose stack up, create your site, enable the scheduler.

## 5. SSL

```bash
apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
certbot --nginx -d pms.yourhotel.com
```

Then sign in at `/hotelpms` as `Administrator` or `admin@example.com` with
the `--admin-password` from the Quickstart — there is no default — and
work through the [production checklist](/self-hosting/#after-install-production-checklist).
